The present day technology available can actually converge architectural, engineering design and geo-spatial data. Cities have the capability to use this precised geo-spatial data and apply it across various infrastructure, including operations and maintenance. This will enable significant changes required to be put in place to check for the town planning and also the management needs.
The creation of virtual city-wide 3D models can help eveyone i.e. the owners, builders, architects, engineers and even the public can understand how and where to prioritise restoration efforts in the case of a natural disaster, so repairs can be made as soon as possible and with precision. This will be helpful for damaged utility networks, whose continous running status is essential for life and business to return back to normal. Furthermore, this model can be used to more effectively plan the cityâ€™s future infrastructure.
If we use digital model of the entire city, it will include both above and underground infrastructure. It will be accessible to city planners, surveyors, engineers, public works and others who may need it and helps indicate where the best areas are for future development.
